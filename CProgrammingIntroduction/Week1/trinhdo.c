Write an algorithr for choosing clothes
to wear for differrent activities involving
differrent weather conditions (e.g., going
to the beach when it is hot, skilling in the
snow, etc.). The algorithm should make
it clear how the choice of clothes
depends on the weather and the activity,
and should be able to cope with a range of
weather conditions.
Hint: Use selection.
